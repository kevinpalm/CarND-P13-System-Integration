For testing generalization we only recorded images from just_traffic_lights.bag for training and were able to successfully detect and classify all traffic lights in the loop_with_traffic_light.bag. There were a few false detections where random objects in the environment were classified as traffic lights but they were very instantaneous and did not affect the performance. To test that the entire pipeline is working we launched site.launch and published a constant current velocity of 1 m/s and set the /vehicle/dbw_enabled to true by publishing a message using rostopic pub from the command line. we validated that the pipeline was working by echoing the /vehicle/brake_cmd topic on the command line. We found that when traffic light is detected as red, brake is applied"
